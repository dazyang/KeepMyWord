# MyWords

This is a personal project I started during EDA Bootcamp. My goal is to create an app that allows me to create wordlists for me to keep track on newly acquired vocabularies and to review them.  

## Wishlist :star2:
**First stage**
- [ ] As a user, I'd like to save and create a list of books I am currently reading.
- [ ] As a user, I'd like to keep a record of the new words I've learnt from the book I am currently reading.
- [ ] I wish, by clicking on the word that have been saved in my list, it will teach me the meaning of the word.

**Second stage**  
More to come
