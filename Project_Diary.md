## Setting my short-term goals and documenting my progresses on the project on a regular basis
**Updated on 4 Jan 1135**  
My goal this afternoon is to wire up routes to let me add new books into the database. I was looking back some of the old exercises/projects we did in bootcamp, I shall use those to guide me through. This is going to be my main focus for the next couple of hours. *1144*
