## Setting my short-term goals and documenting my progresses on the project on a regular basis
**Updated on 4 Jan 1135**  
My goal this afternoon is to wire up routes to let me add new books into the database. I was looking back some of the old exercises/projects we did in bootcamp, I shall use those to guide me through. This is going to be my main focus for the next couple of hours. *1144*

Some progress made: I can now add 'empty data' into the database but not what I have typed in. I spent all afternoon trying to figure this one out, but can't get my head to see the gap. Harrison's catStack example helped a lot when I was blocked, but my app still not doing what it's suppose to do. I'm a little disheartened at the moment, because I should know how to figure this one out, but this is taking way longer than I expected... I have a slight idea where the problem might be at but my concentration is fading â€“ I'm mentally exhausted... Going on a break now to clear my head. *1740*
